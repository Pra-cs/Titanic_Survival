# Titanic_Survival
🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, sex, ticket class, fare, and family size. After cleaning the data and converting categorical values into numeric form, a machine learning model is trained to classify passengers as survived (1) or not survived (0).
